üìä Educational Metrics SQL & Visualization Project
This project explores and analyzes an educational dataset using SQL for data modeling, querying, and analytical insights. It focuses on student performance, study habits, parental involvement, and extracurricular activities to uncover patterns and relationships that impact academic outcomes.

üîç Project Objectives
Design a normalized relational database to store student-related educational metrics.

Populate and analyze data using complex SQL queries.

Derive insights related to GPA, study time, parental support, absences, and more.

Use statistical measures and conditional logic to categorize and rank students.

Identify at-risk students and uncover underperforming patterns despite high effort.

Prepare data for visualization tools (e.g., Tableau, Python) to present insights.
